    <h1>'b' tag</h1>

    <p>
        <b> <!-- b tag -->
            The 'b' HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not
            otherwise
            granted special importance.
            This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.
        </b>
    </p>

    <h1>'i' tag</h1>
    <p>
        <i> <!-- i tag -->
            The 'i' HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such
            as
            idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others.
            Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the 'i'
            naming of
            this element.
        </i>
    </p>

    <h1>'u' tag</h1>
    <p>
        <u> <!-- u tag -->
            The 'u' HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that
            it
            has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered
            using CSS.
        </u>
    </p>

    <h1>'select' tag</h1> <!-- select tag -->
    <p>
        The "select" <select name="" id=""></select> HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.
    </p>

    <h1>"button" tag</h1> <!-- button tag -->
    <p>
        The <button>button</button> HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard,
        finger, voice
        command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs an action, such as submitting a form or
        opening a dialog.

        By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can
        change buttons' appearance with CSS.
    </p>

    <h1>"hr" tag</h1> <!-- hr tag -->
    <p>
        The "hr" HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of
        scene
        in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
        <hr>
        This has been presented as a horizontal rule or line.
    </p>

    <h1>"br" tag</h1> <!-- br tag -->
    <p>
        The "br" HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). <br>
        It is useful for writing a poem or an
        address, where the division of lines is significant.
