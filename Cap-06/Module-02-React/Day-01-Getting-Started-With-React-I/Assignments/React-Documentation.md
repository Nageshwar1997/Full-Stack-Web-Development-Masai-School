# Q.01 What is React?
* JavaScript Library for UI: React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It's especially powerful for creating interactive and dynamic web applications.

* Component-Based Architecture: React follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is built using reusable components. Each component represents a part of the user interface and encapsulates its own logic, making it easier to manage and maintain code.

* Virtual DOM and Declarative Syntax: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize performance by minimizing direct manipulations of the actual DOM. Additionally, it employs a declarative syntax, allowing developers to describe the desired UI state, and React takes care of updating the DOM accordingly, enhancing code readability and maintainability.


# Q.02 Who made React?
React was developed by a team of engineers at Facebook. The project was led by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's news feed in 2011 and later made open source in May 2013. Since then, it has gained widespread adoption in the developer community for building user interfaces, and its open-source nature has allowed contributions from developers worldwide.


# Q.03 What is Babel?
Babel is a JavaScript compiler. It allows developers to write code using the latest ECMAScript (ES) standards or even future standards, and then transforms (compiles) that code into an older version of JavaScript that is compatible with most browsers and environments.

# Q.04 How does Babel convert html code in React into valid code?
Babel does not directly convert HTML code into React; instead, it transpiles JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript often used with React) in HTML-like format into standard JavaScript code that React can interpret and render.
