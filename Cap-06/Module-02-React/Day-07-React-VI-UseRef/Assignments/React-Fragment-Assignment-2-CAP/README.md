 # Task Overview

- Create a React element using JSX with specific requirements. Your task is to demonstrate understanding of React Fragments, JSX syntax, class handling, and event handling in React.

<h2 style="color:red">Follow the Task Instructions</h2>
<p style="font-weight: Bold">Requirements</p>

- Use the boiler  plate provided
- Please be careful and focused as the test cases are case sensitive.

#### Boilerplate Explanation

- The boilerplate already has a functional component `JSXShowcase` given.
- The component has 4 variables declared such as `greeting`, `numbers`, `dooubleNumbers` and `isLoggedIn`.
- Out of 4, two variables `greeting` and `numbers` are already declared.

#### Assign Values to Variables
- Use `map function` on the assigned value of `numbers` to get the values for `doubleNumbers`.
- `doubleNumbers` should be an array of containing double value of each elements present in variable `numbers`.
- Assign only `1` or `0` to the `isLoggedIn`.

#### JavaScript Integration in JSX
- Create a `div` with id `jsi` below to the 
paragraph `This component demonstrates various JSX capabilities.` which is already given in the boilerplate.
- The first `p` tag should display the greeting.
- The second `p` tag should display the numbers by joining the numbers array with `,`. Use `.join()` method  to achieve this.
- The third `p` tag should display the doubleNumbers by joining the array with `,`. Use `.join()` method  to achieve this.


** Please refer to the images to get clarity.

#### Conditional rendering
- Create a `p` after the div wih id `jsi` which will display the `LoggedIn Status` as `1 or 0`. i.e 1 is considered as true and 0 is considered as false.
- Create a `div` with id `cr` which will contain 1 `p` tag and 1 `button` tag.
- The content of the `p` tag and `button` tag will be rendered based on the value you have assigned to the variable `isLoggedIn`.
    - If the LogIn Status is "1" 
          - "p" should show "Welcome back, user!"
          - "button" should show "Logout"

    - If the LogIn Status is "0" 
          - "p" should show "Please log in."
          - "button" should show "Login"


#### Rendering Your Component:
- Ensure your component is correctly rendered within the parent `div` with id `root`.

#### Optional Styling : 
- Apply inline styles to make it visually appealing.
