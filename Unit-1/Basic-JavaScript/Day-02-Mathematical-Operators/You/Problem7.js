// There are some rules for creating a variable name

// 1. The variable name should be self explanatory
let myName = "Nageshwar";
let fatherName = "Punddlikrao";
let surname = "Pawar";

// 2. A variable name cannot start with the number but we can use number between variable name
// let 1name=456;
// but,
let name1 = "nageshwar"

// 3. We cannot use spaces (space) between the variable name
// let name of father = "Pundlikrao";

// 4. A variable can not start with the symbols (but there is one exception for two symbols e.g dollar ($) and underscore (_))
let $name = "Nageshwar";
let _name = "Manjusha";

//5. we cannot use the keyword used by javawscript as a variable name.
let this = "Nageshwar";
let new= "Nag";
let true = 12345;
let let = 456;

// 6. There are two ways of writting a variables

// I) Camel Case
// First letter of each word start with capital letter or expect for the first word, from the second word onward the first letter will be capital case.
let NameOfFather = "Pundlikrao";
let nameOfFather = "Pundlikrao";

// II) Snake Case
// // each word will be seperated by a _
let name_of_father = "Pundlikrao";
let _name_of_father = "Pundliktao";
