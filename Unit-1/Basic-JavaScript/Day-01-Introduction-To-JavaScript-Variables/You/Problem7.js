// JavaScript is a Case Sensitive Language

// 1st way
let x=10;
console.log(x); // we are trying to get the output.

/*here let is a variable
and x is a variable_name
and 10 is a value of a variable_name

now if i want to print the output then i will use the set of rules in JavaScript to print the output--->
console.log(variable_name) // value
*/


// 2nd way
let y; // variable declaration
y=100; // assigning the value to the variable
console.log(y); // 100
