// Code 1: Difference Between 'null' & 'undefined'

let a=null; // null means no value
// if I donot want to have vlaue or do not want to have default javascript.
// it is a value given by us but it does not have any vlaue to it.

console.log(a); // null


let b; // it means variable is declared but value not assigned but JavaScript will automatically assigned as a undefined because undefined is default value of JavaScript

console.log(b); // undefined
